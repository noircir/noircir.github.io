data(mtcars, package="datasets")
str(mtcars)
```

### Plot with base graphics

```{r plot with base graphics}
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
plot(mpg ~ hp , data=mtcars, 
     col=cyl, pch=c(4,6,8)[mtcars$cyl], cex=1.2)
legend("topright", legend=levels(mtcars$cyl),
       pch = c(4,6,8),
       col=levels(mtcars$cyl))
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
